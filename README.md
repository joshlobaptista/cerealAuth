# cerealAuth

Here I used EJS, Mongo DB, Express, Node and passport to make a full stack app for My cereal bar Restaurant Employees to keep track of orders

# How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Mongo DB, Express, and Node

I used an express server on top of Node, with routes to each of my EJS templates and forms. I connected to Mondo DB with Mongoose and there I store the orders on the site.

Lessons Learned:
It was a great learning experience using Express and Mongo DB as well as authentication and passport
